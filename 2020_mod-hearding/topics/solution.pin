# Containers!
# But more seriously

Design Goals

 * Decouple services as much as possible
 * Reduce code complexity
 * Make services self healing
 * Empower the rest of the team
 * Remove me as a bottleneck

# Speak breifly about the goals
# tightly coupled + complexity big barriers
# service hadn't really seen any changes in several years

New Design

Inflator (Mono/C# Runtime)
  * Convert Stub Metadata (.netkan) to Full (.ckan)

Indexer (Python)
  * Detecting/committing  metadata changes
  * Producing metadata status for errors
  * Creating branches/pull requests for mods with special requirements

Scheduler (Python)
  * Interval runs for non-webhooks based netkans
  * Daily runs to catch missed webhooks and changes to netkan

Webhooks (Python/Perl Legacy/Nginx)
  * On Demand Inflation
  * Mirroring to Archive.org

Support Automation
  * Automatically Close Stale Issues

Infrastructure Automation
  * Mod Download Cache Management
  * LetsEncrypt Certificates

# Discreet services in a collection of containers
# - Inflator
# - Indexer
# - Webhooks
# Scheduled Tasks
# - Scheduled indexing runs
# - Cache cleaning
# Benefits
# - Changes can be more focused
# - Logical seperation
# - Inflator can cache expensive operations

# But
# - Free Tier
#   - SQS 1 million/month, we use less
#   - DynamoDB 25 Read/Write credits + 25GB Storage
#   - Systems Manager
# - Automation Tools
#   - ECS + tight integration
#   - CloudFormation
# And it's my day job!
